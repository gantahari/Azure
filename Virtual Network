virtual Network

Network : in general network refers to the collection of computers, devices and systems that are interconnected to share resources, information and communicate with each other.

Virtual Network in azure is a logicall isolated network that allows azure resources to securly communicate with each other, to internet and to on-premises network.
Components:
1. Address space: a range of IP addresses. Azure will assign the next availabe ip address in address space to the resoures.
2. Subnet: it is the logical segmentaion of resources in address space.
3. Vnets are scoped to Region and Subscription. 

Vnet - Vnet Connection:
1. Peering
2. Vnet-Vnet Connection Gateway
3. ExpressRoute

1. Peering allows to connect one vnet to another. Once peered they appers as one.
Types of peering:
a. Vnet Peering: it allows to connecting the virtual networks in same region.
b. Global Peering: It allows to connecting to vnets in different regions.

2. Vnet-Vnet Connection Gateway allows vnets to communicate with eachother over public internet using VPN gateway.

Peering	                                  Vnet-Vnet Connection Gateway
By default no encryption	                Encrypted
Direct, using Private IP communication	  Over Public internet with VPM Gateway
Low Latency	                              High Latency
Can't connect with On-prem Vnet	          Can connect with On-Prem Vnet

3. ExpressRoute
