There are 4main ways we can load balance in azure

1. Load Balancer    2. Application Gateway    3. Front door service    4. Traffic manager

1. Load Balancer
It is a genaral purpose load balancer. It is two types again
- Public Load balancer :: It uses public ip address (2VMS with webserver installed then use load balancer public ip to check which VM connecting)
- Internal Load Balancer :: It uses private ip address (3VMs with 2 in backend pool with webserver installed then use private load balancer to check which VM connecting in backend pool from VM3)

components:
a) Front IP configuration :: This is the ip address of the load balancer 
b) Backend pool :: This is where we need to define the pool of resources that are going to manage by load balancer
c) Health Probe :: This is a special signal that is used by load balancer to check the health of resources in backend pool.
d) Load balancing rule :: associating the frontend ip, backend pool and health probe. 

Trubleshooting in Loadbalancer:
i) VM is not responding to health pool
  reasons:
  -  vm is not health
  -  vm listing port is blocked by NSG
  -  Missconfiguration

ii) VM is not responding to traffic
  reasons:
  - vm data port is blocked by NSG
  - accesing the load balancer from the same VM
  - accesing the private load balancer from the same backend pool resources
